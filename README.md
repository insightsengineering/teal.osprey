# teal.osprey

The teal.osprey package provides community contributed `teal` modules of the analysis functions from the [osprey](https://github.com/insightsengineering/osprey) R package.
This enables `teal` app developers to easily create applications making use of the `osprey` analysis functions.

## Installation

It is recommended that you [create and use a Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_access_token_here")
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("insightsengineering/teal.osprey@*release", dependencies = FALSE)
```

You might need to manually install all of the package dependencies before installing this package as without
the `dependencies = FALSE` argument to `install_github` it may produce an error.

In order to run many of the examples you will also need to install the [`scda`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/scda) package.
