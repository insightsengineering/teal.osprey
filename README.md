The teal.osprey package provides community contributed `teal` modules of the analysis functions from the [osprey](https://insightsengineering.github.io/osprey/) R package.
This enables `teal` app developers to easily create applications making use of the `osprey` analysis functions.

## Installation

For releases from August 2022 it is recommended that you [create and use a Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_access_token_here")
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/teal.osprey@*release")
```

A stable release of all `NEST` packages from June 2022 is also available [here](https://github.com/insightsengineering/depository#readme).

In order to run many of the examples you will also need to install the [`scda`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/scda/) package.
